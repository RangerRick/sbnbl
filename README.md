# What Is It?

SBNation is a consortium of blogs covering a wide variety of sports subjects.

While the majority of SBNation users are great, sometimes, you wish you could
ignore a few of them.  This extension does just that -- it automatically
parses the content of any SBNation site and hides the comments of anyone you
have added to the blacklist.

# How Do I Use It?

First, you must be using either Google Chrome, or Safari.  Other browser
support may be added eventually, but this is the initial implementation. =)
